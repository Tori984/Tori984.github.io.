Stopping Mr Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson for walking in the middle of the road, the policeman grew suspicious that he had carried out the robbery.

Wilson syas Brown attacked Wilson in his police vehicle, according to Wilson, for control of Wilson's gun until it was fired, resulting in an incident. According to Darren Johnson , Wilson allegedly started the fight by grasping Brown's neck through his car window, threatening him, and then shooting at him..

Wilson then shot Brown multiple times until he collapsed to the ground, according to Johnson.

Brown was hit six times in the front of his torso, all in the same spot. Tiffany Mitchell, a witness, told MSNBC that Wilson fired a shot at Brown as he ran away, and that Brown's body jolted as though he had been shot. Brown \"turned around and put his hands up, and the officer continued to approach him and shot him until he went all the way down to the ground,\" according to Mitchell.

Seconds later, the boy lay dying from a police officer’s bullet. “Shots fired, male down,” one of the officers in the car called across his radio. “Black male, maybe 20, black revolver, black handgun by him. Send E.M.S. this way, and a roadblock.”  Garmback quickly reported the shooting to dispatch and requested emergency personnel respond to the scene. But the officers, neither of whom reportedly had first aid kits or training, then stood around without applying first aid for about four minutes after Rice was shot. It wasn’t until an FBI agent — a trained paramedic — walked onto the scene that Rice received first aid. Rice acknowledged the FBI agent, showing signs of life as the agent tried to tend to the boy’s wounds without any medical tools. “He turned over and acknowledged and looked at me, and he, like, reached for my hand,” the agent said, later adding that Rice said his name and mumbled something about the pellet gun. Paramedics arrived a few minutes later. They eventually took Rice to the hospital, where he died on November 23, 2014. The officers on scene faced no chargers." ;
